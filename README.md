## Is this a virus?
__No.__ 
This project is using PyInstaller - a way to package python to an executable file. 
It unfortunetley causes Windows Defender and other antivirus software to mark it as a some sort of trojan.
If you know Python, just take a look at the code to know for yourself or run it on a Virtual Machine.

## The .exe does't work!
It's possible that the .exe file could not work due to problems with packaging .py into .exe. 
There isn't a lot that can be done, except for downloading the raw .py and running it using an IDE like VS Code.
