## Is this a virus?
No. 
This project is using PyInstaller - a way to package python to an executable file. 
It unfortunetley causes Windows and other low-level anti-virus softwares to mark it as a some sort of trojan.
If you know python, just take a look at the code to know for yourself or run it on a VM.
